9c7cbcb7-9daf-4b4b-9279-feea78fa5cbe;ABS;ABS is mainly found in the housings of household appliances, tubes and computer cases. For this reason the "collection" cannot be done separately from the basic product (WEEE-electronic waste). \n ABS is also a thermoplastic material, very hard and shiny, obtained by casting in a mold - a well-known example is LEGO toys. [1] In this particular case, if it is not possible to donate them to kindergartens, children's centers or other charities, they will preferably be collected separately from other waste, in a bag / bag and taken to collection centers that accept this type of waste; videotapes \n CDs and DVDs, including cases;

They are obliged to accept this type of waste without forcing the user to pay or buy a new battery. Batteries and accumulators with damaged or electrolyte leakage must be collected separately in special containers. Be sure to mention this when teaching them. Car and industrial batteries are considered hazardous waste and should not be disposed of. Directive 2006/66 / EC on the regime of batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators mentions the benefits of recycling such waste: take the lead from the plastic wrap. The water transformed from the acid is cleaned, treated and tested to meet the standards and then sent to the public sewer system. The lead is cleaned and melted for reuse. The plastic is sorted by lead and heavy metals and sent to other battery enclosures. Also, plastic resulting from the separation of materials can be sold to manufacturers of plastic objects as a raw material. By 2016, Directive 2006/66 / EC set a 45% recycling target as the minimum collection rate at European level for batteries and accumulators. portable. However, a minimum collection target has not been set for car and industrial batteries and accumulators. Following evaluations at European level, these targets are not sufficient to ensure an optimal level of battery waste collection.

Clothing and other textile products (eg linen bed) must be collected separately from other recyclable waste, put in clean bags, and previously washed. If they are portable, they can be donated to charities or sold as second-hand products & if they are considered reusable, they can be used as cleaning cloths. If they cannot be used for the purposes listed, but are recyclable textiles, they will be transformed into textile fibers and used in the manufacture of thermal or sound-insulating materials or upholstery for chairs and benches. Bed linen, pajamas, shirts can be cut into smaller pieces - cloths to be used for cleaning (dusting cloths, washing tiles, windows, etc.), tablecloths or handkerchiefs, reusable.

For natural fibers, there are several possibilities for both cotton and wool. Carpets can be made of several natural and / or synthetic fibers. The natural fibers used in the manufacture of carpets can be of vegetable origin (cotton, sisal, jute, coconut), but also animal (wool, silk). The synthetic fibers used can be: polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyacrylitrile (PAN). [7]

c0200cc7-90bb-481b-8d52-fc2d356f47e3;Bricks, concrete, rubble; Construction and demolition waste (DCD) is waste resulting from new construction, modernization or demolition of old construction. This type of waste should not be treated in the same way as other types of waste, such as household waste. [1] DCDs are composed of concrete, bricks, rubble, concrete, slabs, tiles, asphalt, etc. They are not biodegradable, often heavy, bulky and overload the landfills. Construction and demolition waste is collected in large containers (at least 3m³) or directly by dump trucks. The collection of this waste - bricks, rubble or concrete - is the responsibility of the citizen to pay for its disposal, because it pollutes. There are also fees for this waste to encourage accountability for pollution. Self-employed persons are required to request the services of specialized or sanitation companies to collect waste.
14c25dab-09f3-4aba-8d90-9926ec6f3e01;Printer cartridges and toner; Printer cartridges will be reused when refilled. This can save up to 60% of the cost of a new cartridge and reduce the amount of waste. The latest printer models on the market offer the possibility of refilling the cartridge even by the user. \n Waste from printer cartridges and toners is collected by specialized operators. Most of this waste comes from companies, being less generated in households. If they cannot be handed over to the collection centers in the area, an authorized collector will be contacted, who will travel to the headquarters / home for a minimum number of cartridges (eg 10 cartridges), depending on the type. of the cartridge. \n Many cartridge manufacturers offer various special programs for collecting printer cartridges and toners (eg buy-back). If used cartridges are sent to them, they will make sure that they are recycled. cartridge recycling is limited, most cartridges can be recycled up to 6 times? They are reconditioned, refilled and then resold to consumers at a lower price than the original new cartridges. Can recycled cartridges have the same quality as new cartridges?
109e8939-c8b7-43b4-9859-d3886946ea44;Cardboard; Remove the adhesive tape from the cardboard boxes. \n The carton must be clean, dry and free from food scraps (eg sauces - as in the case of pizza boxes). If only part of the cardboard is contaminated / dirty, remove the contaminated part (which is collected in household or compostable waste, as appropriate) and the clean part is collected together with the rest of the cardboard waste. Here you can find collection points for cardboard: https://localizare.hartareciclarii.ro/?material=H%C3%A2rtie%20%26%20carton. \n To cover as little volume as possible, the cardboard is folded / flattened so that it reaches a flat shape. The recycling process is the same as for paper. water and various chemicals to separate the fibers from cellulose. The mixture is cleaned of various debris, such as metal staples. The resulting pulp mixture, consisting of 1% fiber and 99% water, is then stretched to form a film, to be pressed to remove much of the water. It is then rolled into rolls and transported to packaging manufacturers, etc. [1]
15206351-c39e-4115-a481-2fdcfe0e14cc;Copper; Any object made of metal can be recycled. The metal is divided into two groups: non-ferrous metals (aluminum, copper, zinc, etc.) and ferrous metals (steel / stainless steel / iron). Use a magnet to figure out which category you fall into. Non-ferrous metals are not magnetic, so the magnet will not stick to them, while ferrous metals are magnetic. \n Metal can come from many sources, from small and large electronics and appliances (some of which are made of different metals - gold, silver, zinc, steel, etc.) to objects used in construction or cans and cans for drinks. \n The most common and valuable recyclable material is aluminum. It is in the form of doses of soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, bottles of perfume or deodorant aerosols; metal containers that have not been emptied of their contents. \n Metal containers for paint or other products, contaminated with solvents or other dangerous substances .;
650fd9ac-dd6a-40ec-91fd-b54bdc975c08;Cans; Have you ever wondered where you can recycle those cans? Cans are used to pack food for animals or people, used as a form of packaging since the 14th century. [1] They are collected in the metal container after being cleaned of any food to prevent contamination. Most cans also have a paper label, which can be removed and collected on paper or can be left on the can. This will be removed in the recycling process. The cans must not have food inside, they must be rinsed with water so as not to contaminate the other materials in the container. The lid should be removed and positioned firmly back in the container to reduce the possibility of an animal sticking its head in and stuck in the container. [1];;
77bc5cdd-c72f-4d0f-9892-0dc1e74c7e3c;Metal lids; metal lids from jars, bottles or cans are collected in the metal container. They must be clean and not contaminated with food. Due to the small size of the lids, they are often lost on the way to recycling plants or sorting stations. These are too small to be identified by sorting machines and most often end up in the landfill. Our advice is to put these metal lids in another larger container of the same metal. Also, if the lid has a plastic cover, be sure to remove it before collecting it separately.
21894cf3-345a-4702-ba44-7783aefb9a41;Organic waste (vegetable waste, food waste); Organic waste generated in households will be collected separately from recyclable waste (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, metals, etc.) as well as from residual household waste. they will donate, as much as possible, to children's centers, old people's homes, people in difficulty or they will be directed to animal shelters. They can also be directed to charities to be distributed to the locations mentioned above. Organic vegetable waste can be composted in the backyard, in a specially arranged corner, or in community urban gardens. If none of these options are possible, they will be handed over to the cleaner as a "wet fraction". dried ”(wilted leaves and flowers), thus ensuring a balance of compost nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium). The compost obtained a few months after collection can be used as fertilizer in your own or community garden.; Wet wipes \n Paper handkerchiefs \n Liquid food (ex. milk) \n Plant debris affected by pests (may affect compost quality);

(these are stored) \n; Some hazardous substances inside WEEE \n Some components of WEEE; WEEE treatment involves their initial sorting by type (refrigerators, CRT equipment, large appliances, IT, etc.). type of equipment there are different types of processes. The large ones - refrigerators, freezers - are dismantled by hand, then the fluids are extracted from them (freon and compressor oil, which are stored in special tanks and sent to specialized recyclers), after which they are crushed like any other waste. The metal parts are separated with the help of magnets, after which the pieces of polyurethane foam are chemically separated. The pieces of non-ferrous metals - those that are not attracted to magnets - are separated from the rest by various methods: centrifugation, immersion of the residue in a liquid (plastic and wood will float, but the metal sinks && since the pieces of iron have already been extracted, only non-ferrous metals remain at the bottom), with the help of electric currents, etc. [2]
e4224cc6-a4f4-43c0-b123-33d40953fbc4;Small electrical, electronic and household waste; A WEEE is recyclable if it meets at least one of the following requirements: \n - Plugs in \n - Uses batteries \n - Requires charging \n - Has a trash can image on wheels cut with an “X” (see below) Often, home appliance stores collect the old product when the new one is delivered - especially larger items such as televisions, refrigerators, and freezers. where there is no option to hand over the old appliance on delivery of the new one, the WEEE can be transported to specialized collection centers (which exist either in stores - for batteries or small appliances - eg Ecotic), or you can request collection from home WEEE, by telephone or through websites available to customers (eg Eco Positive) The collector will be asked what is the minimum quantity for which the collection is made at home / headquarters. \n Before handing over certain WEEE (ex . mobile phones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs), it is advisable to delete personal data from them, so as not to risk being known and used by others.; Cathode tubes of old TVs (they are stored) \n Some hazardous substances inside WEEE \n Some components of WEEE; After collection of electrical waste, it is loaded and transported safely to treatment and recycling operators. The treatment process includes several physical activities (dismantling / cutting, removal of harmful substances from WEEE by certain methods) which results in components (cables, motors, printed circuit boards) and materials (glass, plastic, metal, etc.). which will be subsequently subjected, as the case may be, to additional treatments, recovery, recycling and / or neutralization and non-polluting disposal. Finally, after neutralizing the hazardous substances in order to clean it, it results from meticulously organized technological processes, the secondary raw materials for their reintroduction into the economic circuit (eg the production of goods).

It is available in the form of doses of soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, bottles of perfume or deodorant aerosols; metal containers which have not been emptied of their contents. \n Metallic foil from various foods, such as chocolate or chips, As sorting in dedicated containers is not always done properly, manual sorting is usually done at specialized centers, and then mechanical sorting. uses an electromagnet to separate ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Each category of metal is then processed in a specific way. To make the separation process easier, in most cases the metal is recycled in the same containers as the plastic. They are then sorted at sorting stations. Metal waste must be collected by metal category and taken to specialized recovery centers, where it is sorted, washed, melted, cast into rolls, foil, ingot or roll, and then transformed into new objects.
4c1b5939-e1a8-4f49-8d4b-6dbeb4a51e48;Pre-production textile waste: This type of waste is specific to productive activities (tailoring workshops, clothing factories, knitting factories, spinning mills, etc.), being taken over by authorized collectors for this purpose. \n Most pre-production waste is used in the manufacture of non-woven textiles or can be used for energy by incineration, as a good raw material in the cement industry or in the generation of thermal agent. \n Textile waste from synthetic leather: With regard to synthetic fibers, options are limited, with few companies recycling polyester fabrics. For natural fibers, there are several possibilities for both cotton and wool, with recycled fibers and yarns made from post-consumer sources being available on the market. The recycling process involves: From a technological point of view, the recovery of textiles is achieved by:

bd74d9a8-1775-4c3a-b06f-e66d122f7fb7;Fiber Optic; Fiber optic is a glass or plastic fiber that carries light along it. Fiber optics are widely used in telecommunications. They allow transmissions over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than other communication media. Fibers are used instead of metal cables because the signal is transmitted with lower losses and is immune to electromagnetic interference. Fiber optics are also used for lighting and image transport, allowing viewing in narrow areas. Some specially designed optical fibers are used in various other applications, including sensors and lasers; Unfortunately, in Romania fiber optics are of no interest to most collectors and there are not many recycling technologies.  It is burned in cement plants or incineration plants.;
52f57fd7-df49-4ed0-b37c-749599607700;Water filters; Most water filters are composed of the filter itself (carbon, resin, ion exchange, etc.). It helps to reduce the alkalinity of the water (limescale deposits) and also contains certain heavy metals, such as lead and copper, as well as plastic with the coding 5 (a type of hard recyclable plastic). \n After use, the water filters are left to dry for approx. 3 days. If possible, several used filters will be collected before being handed over to an authorized collector. It can be a collector of electrical and electronic waste - WEEE - ex. in the case of power purifiers. \n As they do not have a separate collection flow, it is recommended that you contact the manufacturer / distributor. You can contact him on his website, or consult the FAQ (Questions and Answers) section, to receive the most qualified instructions on collecting and handing over waste water filters. Many manufacturers have developed filter cartridge recycling programs as a component of social responsibility programs. \n If possible, try to repair the filter / replace some components. To avoid waste, buy high-quality filters with a long shelf life (even if their price is often higher). \nIf collection and recycling information is not available, the filters will be sent to the Recyclable Waste Collection Centers.

Solid or liquid waste can contaminate other recyclable waste that comes in contact with it. It also complicates the automatic sorting process and can even damage the equipment in the sorting and recycling facilities. \n Containers are pressed as much as possible to reduce volume; Containers of products containing chemicals (eg caustic soda products). plastic, as they may contain hazardous substances). \n Bottles for mineral (motor) oils, as some recyclers explicitly require that they not be placed in plastic collection containers. Although they are made of HDPE, they often contain traces of mineral oil; The waste enters a conveyor belt, where it is cleaned, then sorted by color, then enters the grinding-washing lines, where it is shredded, washed repeatedly and dried. HDPE (high density polyethylene) and LDPE (low density polyethylene) are recycled in a similar way to PET bottles. What is different is the final product: they are transformed into recycled raw materials for durable plastic items - tables, chairs, benches, trash cans, buckets, rulers, etc. Recycled LDPE can also be used to make plasticized wood or plastic wrap. [2] Unlike PETs, however, LDPE (low density polyethylene) plastic bags must be melted after being chopped and washed. In the end, some polyethylene or polypropylene granules are obtained, from which foils, garbage bags, even molded plastic products are produced.

The collection can be started if, by passing your hand lightly over the pan, you no longer feel hot steam. \n Strain the used grease, being careful not to mix the filtered grease with other impurities or water. Using a strainer and a funnel, pour the liquid fat into the collection container (which can be a plastic, metal or glass can). The collection container should be tightly closed so as not to give off unpleasant odors. \n When a sufficiently large quantity (eg 5 kg) has been collected, an authorized collector is contacted to pick up the containers at home / office. \n Many organizations that collect used cooking oil and grease in exchange offer edible cooking oils or cleaning products (eg sunflower, palm, olein, detergents); food fats with unfiltered impurities. \n Food fats mixed with water, mineral oils, motor oil, brake or transmission fluid, chemicals, food scraps or other waste .;

You can find it on the packaging with the code PS. At the moment, in Romania, there are not many collectors, being a material with a very low value. It often reaches the landfill. PVC or polyvinyl chloride is another type of plastic, but it cannot be used in Romania. Processing costs are high, but the final product is not of good quality. Profiles for double-glazed windows, some of the most common types of windows, are made of this material.;;

For example, some containers accept only PET, others only foil or other types; Containers of products contaminated with hazardous chemicals; Although so resistant to degradation, PET is 100% recyclable. Recycled packaging can be used to make clothing (eg T-shirts, fleece blouses, etc.) Approximately 60% of the world's production of PET / HDPE / polyester from natural sources is used in textile fibers. There are large clothing manufacturers that use only fibers made from recycled PET / polyester, but the products are clean and hygienic, with the recycling process involving washing, removing impurities (such as label paper and lids) and contaminants, grinding, chopping, washing (again). ), drying and processing of flake material - raw material for textile fibers or other packaging of PET.

e7f32612-7387-4478-820e-e7f34f9c28dd;Wooden furniture; In Romania there is no infrastructure to ensure separate waste collection containers for wood (eg old or damaged furniture).  Legal entities have the obligation to collect separately the wood waste generated (usually from wooden packaging - pallet boxes, but also from wood processing - sawdust and, less often, from furniture replacement). These are subsequently collected by specially authorized companies. \n Since the collection of old furniture implies the need to ensure adequate space, which is a problem for most families, one of the feasible solutions is to turn to the companies for the collection and recycling of old furniture. \n When contacting the furniture collection company, citizens should provide it with some necessary information, such as: the materials from which the old furniture is made (eg solid wood, MDF, contains glass, metal, etc.), in which degree of wear is (if it can be restored or is irreparably destroyed), size and quantity. Most of the old furniture collection companies can also request pictures of the recycled furniture. [1] \n Another great solution to get rid of old furniture is to work with your local sanitation company. Some companies offer free lifting of furniture, at certain dates and time intervals or within certain quantitative limits (eg free of charge for 1 sofa or 2 armchairs, but for a fee to pick up a larger quantity). Also, more and more town halls are organizing “disposal” campaigns in collaboration with local sanitation companies, which are advertised on the websites of the respective town halls or in local newspapers.;Wastes from composite materials whose separation for recycling involves a high cost .; Wood waste is taken to recovery centers, where it is tested for contaminated wood waste (painted wood) and unwanted materials such as dust, rocks, garbage. When it comes to treated wood, the preservatives used are more problematic. As it is not easy to see whether or not the wood used has pollutants, there are no companies anywhere that accept the recovery of recyclable materials contained in wood of different origins. The risk of harmful substances affecting the atmosphere during chopping or heat treatment of wood is very high. Therefore, the recycling of treated wood is generally abandoned, it is incinerated or gasified in installations specially designed for energy production, transformed into charcoal by thermal processes or cellulose [2] Recycling - durability versus quality
c207c61f-b3de-451c-8044-7201cc200d4e;Facial masks; Masks and gloves have a special collection regime, being a hazardous waste. The concern for the collection of non-recyclable plastic facial masks has existed since they began to be widely used. Various shopping malls have set up special masks to collect masks for responsible disposal. From March 2021, disposable masks can be collected in a pilot environmental project initiated by the organization "My City, My Colors", with the support of Kaufland Romania. These can be collected in the 17 Kaufland stores in Bucharest. Another option for safe collection of masks and gloves is the baskets dedicated to hazardous waste located in large malls or supermarkets, a basket marked with yellow and the radioactive symbol .;
c3f05af0-9815-4782-976a-d7f9be84f588;Medicines; All types of medicines are hazardous waste, so they must be collected separately and NOT thrown in the trash, toilet or sink after the expiry date. Medicines can be delivered free of charge to pharmacies for final disposal by incineration. However, only some pharmacies have contracts with companies specializing in the disposal of hazardous waste and a functional system for taking medicines. [1] They are collected in special packaging that ensures safe transport to the place of incineration. Expired medicines must be collected so as not to contaminate the soil and groundwater, firstly because it is harmful to our health and secondly because has harmful effects on plants and animals. Medicines can cause environmental damage, as water filtration systems are not effective in removing harmful substances. Here you will find a model report for the delivery of medicines.

Companies that sell windshields usually work with companies that can recycle them. Ask your supplier what you can do with your old windshield when you buy a new one. Thus, through the combination of materials the windshield becomes stronger, resisting minor damage. [1];;

These can be handed over to the collector who takes them from home / office, taken to the green street containers or to the collection centers in the area. \n Jars can be left with the label / foil removed, but the metal caps must be removed. The lids will be collected separately, along with other metal objects. The jars will be emptied of food scraps and the corks from the wine bottles must be removed. \n Bottles, jars and containers containing medicines or dangerous substances (biocides, paints, etc.) will NOT be collected together with bottles and jars in which food or human packaging has been packaged, but will be collected together with other wastes containing dangerous substances and handed over to an authorized collector. \n Every effort will be made to prevent the glass from breaking. Broken glass is dangerous for the person handling it. If, however, the bottle breaks, it will be wrapped in a bag before being thrown away, so that the sanitation workers do not injure themselves by handling it .; Porcelain, crystal, ceramics \n Drinking glasses and plates \n Heat resistant dishes - e.g. Jena vessels (melting point different from glass used in packaging) \n Microwave oven support plates \n Ceramic mirrors, windows, sinks (for this type of waste it will be necessary to find a collector of construction and demolition waste, which would be pre-scheduled) \n Packaging of medicines and cosmetics with dangerous contents (eg paints, nail polishes) \n Bulbs and neon lights (although they are made of glass, this is treated and cannot be recycled with glass packaging & these products are recycled separately.; Brown glass absorbs most ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths less than 450 nm (nanometers), providing the best protection against potentially harmful light. (Beer, for example, would be qualitatively affected if it were bottled in clear glass packaging) .Green glass provides protection against light, but not as much like brown glass. Transparent glass is best used for bottling products that are not affected by light exposure (alcohol, water, sauces, etc.).

In the meantime, you can prepare a container in which to collect it. We recommend using 2 or 5 liter plastic bottles, as they are easier to transport and can be broken. \n The oil should be allowed to cool, as hot can cause severe burns if inadvertently gets on the skin. Second, it could cause plastic bottles to melt. After the oil has cooled, use a funnel to carefully pour it into the bottle. If you do not have a funnel at hand, make one yourself. It's simple: cut the top of a bottle (smaller than the one in which you want to collect the oil), remove the lid and it's ready - you only have a funnel to use. \n After collecting the oil, it must be transported to a collection center, from where it will be sent to a recycling company. \n The reuse of cooking oil depends on several factors, including temperature, time and purpose. Always filter food scraps, do not mix different oils, and keep the cooking temperature below 190 degrees Celsius to reduce the risk of the oil becoming dangerous to use. \n As a rule of thumb, animal fats and proteins of any kind should not be composted because compost piles do not become hot enough to break down animal fats, creating potential for mold growth. It is safest to remove fat from the compost; • used oil mixed with water or mineral oils, engine oil, brake or transmission fluid, chemicals, food scraps or other waste, as it can no longer be recycled. \n • several types of vegetable oil mixed in the same container (eg sunflower, coconut, palm, etc.), because they are more difficult to recycle !;

For added safety, place a tarpaulin on the work area. Place a suitable container on top of the tarpaulin and under the engine to collect the oil as it drains. \n Empty the oil filter: start by making a small hole in the filter dome and let it drain well into the same container in which you collected the leaking oil. Then seal the filter in a bag. Even after draining, it may still contain recyclable oil. \n When you're done, you may need to transfer the oil to another container for storage and transport. The container in which the oil came would be the best way to store it. \n Once the used oil has been stored properly, close the lid and keep the container in a cool, dry place away from heat, sunlight, children and pets.; Car oil that has been mixed with other fluids (liquid washing, petrol, water, antifreeze, brake fluid, etc.); Used car oil can be taken to authorized collection centers. These can be auto parts stores or service centers that accept used engine oil and used oil filters for recycling. Waste oil can be turned into fuel to heat homes or burned in power plants to generate electricity. At the same time, used oil can be a raw material for the refining and petrochemical industries. In addition, waste oil filters contain reusable iron. Once the car oil is recovered, it is cleaned of dirt and can be used again. Don't Toss That Used Motor Oil!
e6f00396-1ef6-4010-91b9-be82b5c4cd27;Doors, beams, other demolition wood; Construction and demolition waste (DCD) is waste resulting from new construction, modernization or demolition of old construction. This type of waste should not be treated in the same way as other types of waste, such as household waste. [1] DCDs are composed of concrete, bricks, plaster, as well as wood, metal, rubble and insulating materials (polystyrene, mineral wool), etc. They are not biodegradable, often heavy, bulky and overload the landfills. Construction and demolition waste is collected in large containers (at least 3m³) or directly by dump trucks. The collection of this waste is the responsibility of the citizen to pay for its disposal, because it pollutes. There are also fees for this waste to encourage accountability for pollution. Self-employed people are required to seek the services of specialist or sanitation companies to collect waste. The European Union has set a standard that involves the separate separation of this waste and its handling as industrial waste. Recycling construction and demolition waste means reducing the production costs of new materials. Recovering these materials that remain after construction and demolition means reducing the use of raw resources (more than 50% of the materials extracted from the earth are transformed into construction materials). A European directive requires that at least 70% of DCD be recycled and reused by 2020. [2];;

The components and materials from which they are made are also classified as "obsolete" and end-of-life waste, being considered as end-of-life vehicles. According to the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive (2000/53 / EC), which entered into force in 2007, manufacturers must ensure - at the design and construction stage - that the materials and components of can be disassembled, reused and recovered. From 2015, manufacturers must ensure that new vehicles are reusable and / or recyclable in a proportion of at least 85% of their weight. accepted free of charge. They must meet certain conditions: the vehicle is a passenger vehicle, with a maximum of nine seats and a maximum weight of 3.5 tonnes && \n is complete, ie it has the essential components, including the engine, transmission, body, wheels and catalytic converter (if if applicable) && \n does not contain any additional waste (for example, household waste, additional tires);

The paint must be removed professionally, being specially processed for disposal, if it can no longer be used. The paint is of several types, depending on the composition, and the recycling processes are different. What can you do to make the paint last longer? It does not keep the container open for very long. \n When you stop using it, make sure you put the lid on properly and the air can't get in. \n Store it in a cool, dry place.
6362fb4b-43c4-4922-ae2d-3a001b23a4be;Zinc; Any object made of metal can be recycled. The metal is divided into two groups: non-ferrous metals (aluminum, copper, zinc, etc.) and ferrous metals (steel / stainless steel / iron). Use a magnet to figure out which category you fall into. Non-ferrous metals are not magnetic, so the magnet will not stick to them, while ferrous metals are magnetic. \n Metal can come from many sources, from small and large electronics and appliances (some of which are made of different metals - gold, silver, zinc, steel, etc.) to objects used in construction or cans and cans for drinks. \n The most common and valuable recyclable material is aluminum. It is available in the form of doses of soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, bottles of perfume or deodorant aerosols; metal containers that have not been emptied of their contents. \n Metallic foil from various foods, such as chocolate or chips; Because sorting in dedicated containers is not always done properly, manual sorting is usually done at specialized centers, and then mechanical sorting, which uses an electromagnet, to separate ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Each category of metal is separated into categories: zinc, steel, aluminum, etc. To make the separation process easier, in most cases the metal is recycled in the same containers as the plastic. They are then selected at sorting stations. Zinc or other metal waste must be collected by metal category and taken to specialized recovery centers, where it is sorted, washed, melted, rolled, foil, ingot or roll, and then processed into new objects.
